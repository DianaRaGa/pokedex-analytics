This project is a learning journey where my main goal is to apply everything I've learned from the Python for Everybody course by Dr. Chuck on Coursera.
Learning to code and program has been both incredibly rewarding and terrifying at the same time. I've felt accomplished on many occasions, but putting this project together has honestly been nerve-wracking. It's way outside of my confort zone, and sharing my learning process with the world is scary.
My long-term goal is to create more projects that can help me break into the world of data analysis, and eventually data science. I never imagined that taking the first step toward something that brings me real satisfaction and fulfillment could feel this hard. To ease into it, I decided to start with something fun and entertaining. That way, I could focus on the data itself and immerse myself in the process, instead of getting stuck on the intimidating parts of programming.
This project involves creating a script to scrape Pokémon data from the official Pokémon website. After that, I plan to clean the data and build a simple database, followed by exploring insigts within that data. The final step will be designing a dashboard that allows users to filter Pokémon by different attributes and view the information in a meaningful and visual way.
